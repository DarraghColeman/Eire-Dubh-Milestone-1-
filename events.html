            <p>As a once gone and once returned Irish emigrant myself, I have found a fascination in the 
                paths of other Irish across the globe and what brought them there.
                With the most remote Irish pubs not being in Donegal, the Kerry mountains or Aran Islands,
                but in the Himalayas, Patagonia, Mongolia, the Andes... it's clear to see how far Irish feet have
                travelled.
                However, there are a number of countries in which the Irish mainly settled, either by choice, necessity or by force.
                The principle locations and events that caused the migrations were as follows:</p>

            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>
                Over the last decade there has been a steady flow of Irish emigrants all across
                the globe.  However in recent times, the reasons for leaving have changed from economic necessity to include better and
                more varied opportunities abroad, the cost of living and housing crisis in Ireland, chance to acrue wealth, adventure and a retirement in the sun.
                In addition to the above countries, today many Irish people are deciding to settle in the Middle-East, South-East Asia and the Mediterranean.
                Times may have changed, but Éire Dubh will still always have articles to write...
