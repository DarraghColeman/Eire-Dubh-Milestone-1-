                <!-- <p>As a once gone and once returned emigrant myself, it is fascinating to hear the 
                    paths of other Irish emigrants' experiences and what brought them there.</p>
                <br> -->
                <p>The vast majority of Irish emigrants today are young, well-educated and skilled people 
                    coming from an affluent country. They leave seeking opportunity, adventure or education abroad.
                    With internet and travel accessibility now it's relative easy for emigrants to keep in touch
                    with loved ones and to take trips home.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, this was not always the case as our ancestors did not have such privilages coming from
                    extremely impoverished circumstances. Many went from poverty in Ireland to poverty in a new land.
                    Even worse still, many were exiled for their religion or political beliefs and forced into
                    a life of servitude or slavery. Less than a century ago, an Irish person leaving their native country
                    would be assumed to never set foot on it again.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Today the Irish are broadly welcomed around the world, but often Irish communities abroad were treated 
                    with disdain and discrimination. Therefore, it's important to consider the circumstances which led to 
                    the making of a some of our featured forgotten friends.</p>

            <p>
                Over the last decade there has been a steady flow of Irish emigrants all across
                the globe.  However in recent times, the reasons for leaving have changed from economic necessity to include better and
                more varied opportunities abroad, the cost of living and housing crisis in Ireland, chance to acrue wealth, adventure and a retirement in the sun.
                In addition to the above countries, today many Irish people are deciding to settle in the Middle-East, South-East Asia and the Mediterranean.
                Times may have changed, but Éire Dubh will still always have articles to write...
