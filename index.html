                <br>
                <p>As we tend to laud the many successful and famous emigrants, and often attempting to lay claim on those with tenuous connections 
                    to our tiny island, many notable people and events abroad have gone under the radar. The phrase <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ah sure, we export all our best stuff!"</span>
                    isn't so true as not all those who wandered abroad brought <span style="font-style: italic;">craic agus ceol</span>.</p>

                <p>So for better or for worse, we bring you a collection of histories of the <span style="font-style: italic;">down-trodden, dark</span> and down-right <span style="font-style: italic;">dispicable</span> diaspora of Ireland.</p>

                <p>As a once gone and once returned Irish emigrant myself, I have found a fascination in the 
                    paths of other Irish across the globe and what brought them there.
                    With the most remote Irish pubs not being in Donegal, the Kerry mountains or Aran Islands,
                    but in the Himalayas, Patagonia, Mongolia, the Andes... it's clear to see how far Irish feet have
                    travelled.
                    However, there are a number of countries in which the Irish mainly settled, either by choice, necessity or by force.
                    The principle locations and events that caused the migrations were as follows:
                    Napoleonic Wars - Europe
                    South American revolutions - Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Brazil.
                    Irish rebellions, exile/penal colonies - The Carribbean, Australia, New Zealand.
                    The Great Potato Famine - USA, Canada, the UK
                    Economic crisis in Ireland - the UK, USA, Canada, Australia
                </p>

                <h3>Today</h3>
                <p>
                    Since the 2000's there has been a large and steady flow of Irish emigrants all across
                    the globe.  However in recent times the reasons for leaving have changed from economic necessity to include better and
                    more varied opportunities abroad, the cost of living and housing crisis in Ireland, chance to acrue wealth, adventure and a retirement in the sun.
                    In addition to the above countries, today many Irish people are deciding to settle in the Middle-East, South-East Asia and the Mediterranean.
                    Times may have changed, but one thing is the strength of Irish crime syndicates' operations abroad have ensured
                    that Éire Dubh will still always have articles to write...
