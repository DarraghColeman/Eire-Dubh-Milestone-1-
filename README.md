Éire Dubh
Éire Dubh (Black Ireland) is a website that looks at the dark pasts of obscure Irish emigrants, or with Irish heritage. Whereas other websites might deal with positive or famous examples, this site looks at the people who didn't make it to our history books or who aren't as well known due to the fact that their actions aren't looked upon positively here or abroad. It also briefly looks at the
history of Irish migration and the causes behind each wave to give the reader more background.



Responsice Mockup

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

Existing Features
Navigation Bar

Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home, People, Places and Contact pages. It is as fixed bar so the user does not need to scroll back to the top of the page to change pages.
On smaller devices, the page links are accessed via a full page drop-down menu which appears on clicking a burger menu icon.
Nav Bar

Home page

The landing or home page includes a banner section of a phot with text overlay. This introduces the viewer to the page's dark theme. This banner section is used on all pages except the Contact page.

Landing Page

'About' section

The About section gives the visitor more details on the purpose of the website and directs attention to the 'People' page, which is the focus of the website.
Club Ethos

'Nature or Nurture?' section

This section's content directs the visitor to the 'Places' page to understand the circumstances and background behind the articles. A link at the end of the content brings the user directly to the page.
Meetup Times

Cards section

The cards section consist of links to the articles in the 'People' page with supporting taglines and images of each figure. This allows the user to go directly to the article without having to scroll back up to the top of the page.
This cards section is also found on the 'Places' page.

Footer

The footer section includes links to social media sites Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest for Éire Dubh. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and to keep the user on the Éire Dubh website too.
Footer

People page

The People page follows the same layout of the 'Home' page without the cards section. Its content consists of three brief stories, each following the same layout of alternating image and text, and is divided by styled horizontal rules and headers. Each story also links to Wikipedia's longer more detailed articles about the figures.
Gallery

Places Page

The 'Places' page follows the same layout as above, with a cards section linking to the 'People' articles. This page functions as a supporting page to give the visitor more background information about Irish emigration and the circumstances surrounding the figures. It also briefly comments on Irish emigration today.

Features Left to Implement
Other future features would be to include a 'Reccommended' page which would promote authors, media, other websites or related content, and direct the user to them via links.

Testing
Testing was taken across various browsers and screen sizes. I tested the site on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Opera. Across all browsers the site responded and appeared identical from small screen devices up to large screens. However, through this testing I discovered a bug when opened with Firefox.
The bug, in the footer section, consisted of misaligned bordered circles surrounding the social media icons. It only occurred when using Firefox inspect console with small devices lower than 440px. This seemed unusual as no properties or media queries were set as such. I attempted to rectify the problem through re-styling the circles but was unsuccessful. Some online research showed that other users found similar bugs with the Firefox inspect console, but rather than fully trusting in this and allowing the issue to remain,  as a small non-essential feature I decided to comment out the circles in the stylesheet for now.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
