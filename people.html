                        <p>Mary Mallon (23/09/1869 - 11/11/1938), commonly known as Typhoid Mary, was a
                         cook believed to have infected between 51 to 122 people with typhoid fever between 1900-1907 in New York. 
                         The infections caused three confirmed deaths, with unconfirmed estimates of up to 50.</p>
                        <p>Even after suspicions arose towards Mallon as the root cause she persisted in working as a cook, thereby exposing others to the disease. 
                          Because of that, she was twice forcibly quarantined by authorities, eventually for the final two decades of her life. 
                          Mallon died after a total of nearly 30 years in isolation.</p>

                        <p>From 1900 to 1907, Mallon worked as a cook in the New York City area for eight families, seven of whom contracted typhoid.
                            A pattern emerged of illness emerging in the homes a short time after Mallon's employment, who would then either leave or be fired after
                            the outbreak. This followed Mallon around for the next 6 years, causing the death of two people, until authorities tracked the cases and
                            caught up to her.</p>
                        <p>She refused to cooperate, threatening authorities with a fork, and required 5 police officers to restrain her.
                            It was discovered that Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier of the typhoid disease, possibly due to her mother contracting it
                            during pregnancy.

                        <p>Being the first case of an asymptomatic typhoid carrier, sadly a media frenzy ensued 
                            and Mallon became a guinea pig for the medical community. She remained quarantined 
                            for the next three years until she was allowed to leave when she agreed to never work
                            as a cook again.</p>
                        <p>Two unsuccessful years passed and Mallon returned to the better paying cook position.
                             Immediately, typhoid outbreaks occurred and Mallon fled, often changing her surname. Again,
                            and after two more deaths, the authorities caught up and this time Mallon was to spend the 
                            rest of her life quarantined on Brother Island, New York.</p>

                        <p>James Sligo Jameson (17/08/1856-17/08/1888) was a naturalist known for expeditions in Africa and Asia, and his collections
                            of rare birds, butterflies, insects and drawings of native wildlife and peoples. However, he trully made his name from his 
                            part in a grisly incident on one such expedition.</p>
                        <p>Jameson was born into the wealthy Jameson Irish Whiskey family, grandson of its founder John Jameson. After a high level
                            education in Scotland and England, he joined the army but soon realised that travel was his calling. He travelled extensively
                            through Borneo, South Africa, the Kalahari Desert and Central Africa, the latter of which is where the incident took place.

                        <p>The Emin Pasha Relief Expedition (1886-1889) was an ill-fated operation, led by Henry Morton Stanley. Its purpose
                            was to travel up the Congo river to rescue the beseiged governer of Equatoria, Emin Pasha. It was also the first to 
                            penetrate into the heart of Africa, and many adventurers and naturalists joined up.</p>
                        <p>According to first-hand accounts and of Jameson's own diary, the expedition arrived to a tribe that practiced ritualistic
                            cannibalism. Jameson offered the price of six white handkerchiefs to purchase a young female slave. An avid draughtsman, 
                            the girl was then offered to the tribe for the purpose of Jameson drawing the ritual.

                    <div>
                        <p>By Jameson's own records, he was incredulous of the practice. His part in the event was 
                            supposedly a misunderstanding and that he made the purchase as a joke. In a letter to his wife he said:</p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">“I sent my boy for six handkerchiefs, thinking it was all a joke, 
                            and that they were not in earnest, but presently a man appeared, leading a young girl of about 
                            10 years old by the hand, and then I witnessed the most horribly sickening sight I am ever likely to see in my life."</p>
                        <p>According to Assad Farran, a Sudanese translator on the trip, Jameson expressed interest in seeing cannibalism first hand.
                            And of the event itself Farran said:</p>
                        <p style="font-style: italic;">“Jameson, in the meantime, made rough sketches of the horrible scenes...Jameson afterward went 
                            to his tent, where he finished his sketches in watercolors.”</p>
                        <p>Jameson passed away shortly after the accusations and the controversy was quickly swept under the carpet. However, the 
                            media focus was enough so that such an expedition was the last of its kind.</p>
