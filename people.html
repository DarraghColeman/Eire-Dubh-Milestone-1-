                        <p>Mallon (23/09/1869 - 11/11/1938), commonly known as Typhoid Mary, was a
                         cook believed to have infected between 51 to 122 people with typhoid fever between 1900-1907 in New York. 
                         The infections caused three confirmed deaths, with unconfirmed estimates of up to 50.</p>
                        <p>Even after suspicions arose towards Mallon as the root cause she persisted in working as a cook, thereby exposing others to the disease. 
                          Because of that, she was twice forcibly quarantined by authorities, eventually for the final two decades of her life. 
                          Mallon died after a total of nearly 30 years in isolation.</p>

                        <p>From 1900 to 1907, Mallon worked as a cook in the New York City area for eight families, seven of whom contracted typhoid.
                            A pattern emerged of illness emerging in the homes a short time after Mallon's employment, who would then either leave or be fired after
                            the outbreak. This followed Mallon around for the next 6 years, causing the death of two people, until authorities tracked the cases and
                            caught up to her.</p>
                        <p>She refused to cooperate, threatening authorities with a fork, and required 5 police officers to restrain her.
                            It was discovered that Mallon was an asymptomatic carrier of the typhoid disease, possibly due to her mother contracting it
                            during pregnancy.

                        <p>Being the first case of an asymptomatic typhoid carrier, sadly a media frenzy ensued 
                            and Mallon became a guinea pig for the medical community. She remained quarantined 
                            for the next three years until she was allowed to leave when she agreed to never work
                            as a cook again.</p>
                        <p>Two unsuccessful years passed and Mallon returned to the better paying cook position.
                             Immediately, typhoid outbreaks occurred and Mallon fled, often changing her surname. Again,
                            and after two more deaths, the authorities caught up and this time Mallon was to spend the 
                            rest of her life quarantined on Brother Island.</p>
