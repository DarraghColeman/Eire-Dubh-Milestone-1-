                        <p>From Tipperary to Timbuktu, Mayo to Machu Pichu, the Irish are all over. It is estimated that up to 80 million
                            people worldwide claim Irish heritage, making it one of the largest diasporas in the world. Even more astonishingly
                            is the fact that those this diaspora dwarves Ireland itself being 13 times larger than the population on the island itself.

                            Even worse still, many were exiled for their religion or political beliefs and forced into
                            a life of servitude or slavery. Less than a century ago, an Irish person leaving their native country
                            would be assumed to never set foot on it again.</p>

                        <p>Today the Irish are broadly welcomed around the world, but often Irish communities abroad were treated 
                            with disdain and discrimination. Many found themselves in segregated slums which lead to the formation of 
                            organised crime gangs.</p>

                            Over the last decade there has been a steady flow of Irish emigrants all across
                            the globe.  However in recent times, the reasons for leaving have changed from economic necessity to include better and
                            more varied opportunities abroad, the cost of living and housing crisis in Ireland, chance to acrue wealth, adventure and a retirement in the sun.
                            In addition to the above countries, today many Irish people are deciding to settle in the Middle-East, South-East Asia and the Mediterranean.
